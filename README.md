# CVE-to-Metasploit
Script to automatically search for Metasploit Modules from Rapid7 Vulnerability Database.

## Requirements:
1. The script works on selenium so geckodriver/chromedriver
2. An excel file with list of CVE-IDs
3. selenium, pandas, time and csv libraries

## How to run:
1. Mention path of geckodriver
2. Mention path of excel file
3. Mention path of output file (end of python document csvfile variable)
4. Change data.parse(<2>) to data.parse(<sheet number in your excel file which contains CVE>)

#### Output will be a csv file with CVE-ID and corresponding page link from Rapid7 Vulnerability Database which contains details of metasploit module related to the CVE-ID


#### NOTE: Adjust ( time.sleep(\<value>) ) \<value> to run the script faster. If the internet connection is bad then it is recommended that the time.sleep values are higher so that the page can load properly
